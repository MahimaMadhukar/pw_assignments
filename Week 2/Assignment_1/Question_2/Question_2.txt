2.Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and 
provide an example of how to use comments in an 
HTML document.
•	Comments are useful when we want to write something about the code, but we do not want to run that or show it in the output. 
•	Comments are basically for humans; we write comments for our future selves or for other developers who might work on the same codebase.
•	Comments are not displayed in the web browser when you view the web page. They are only visible when you inspect the page's HTML source code
